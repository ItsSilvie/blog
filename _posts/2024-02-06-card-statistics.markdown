## Introduction

The tables in this article break down each section into 2 columns:

- `Cards` shows the number of unique cards from that section and their editions. For example, if an entry from a section has features on three "Trusty Steed" cards it will show "1 (3 editions)" - counting the named card once;
- `Variants` shows the different foil variants (foil + non-foil) and foil count.

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Note that the editions count does not show the number of unique artworks, only the number different set and rarity combinations a card appears in. If the same artwork appears on 3 different Trusty Steed cards, for example, it will show 3 editions regardless.</p>
