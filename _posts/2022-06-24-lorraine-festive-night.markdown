## SAMPLE PROMO-000

Three days before Christmas on 22nd December 2021 the Grand Archive developers announced Lorraine, Festive Night as holiday promotional card in [Kickstarter update #7](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3392207).

Illustrated by <span class="dead-link">[十尾](/illustrators#十尾)</span> and announced at the same time as the Clarent, Sword of Peace <span class="dead-link">[Kickstarter promo](/kickstarter-promo)</span>, the SAMPLE PROMO-000 Lorraine, Festive Night was the first Grand Archive promo card to be revealed in full.

Being a sample card itself, this card - with its ability to allow all players to win simultaneously - is sadly not tournament legal.

***Trivia:** Despite featuring a different name and artwork, Lorraine, Festive Night is officially regarded as the 3rd iteration of the [Lorraine, Wandering Warrior sample cards](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples).*

This was the first card printed to feature <span class="dead-link">[Silvie](/champions#silvie)</span>, and the first card to include two champions in its artwork.

### Variants

Two foil variants of the Lorraine, Festive Night card were released together: <span class="dead-link">[star foil](/foil#star-foil)</span> and <span class="dead-link">[normal foil](/foil#normal-foil)</span>.

Star foil features a layer of holofoil star outlines of various shapes between the background and the two champions. Presumably as an oversight, the star foil pattern also covers the material cost and life count icons.
