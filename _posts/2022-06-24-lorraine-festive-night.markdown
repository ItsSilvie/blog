## SAMPLE PROMO-000

Three days before Christmas on 22nd December 2021 the Grand Archive developers announced Lorraine, Festive Night as holiday promotional card in [Kickstarter update #7](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3392207).

Illustrated by <span class="dead-link">[十尾](/illustrators#十尾)</span> and announced at the same time as the Clarent, Sword of Peace [Kickstarter promo](/KSP_(set)), the SAMPLE PROMO-000 Lorraine, Festive Night was the first Grand Archive promo card to be revealed in full.

Being a sample card itself, this card - with its ability to allow all players to win simultaneously - is sadly not tournament legal.

***Trivia:** Despite featuring a different name and artwork, Lorraine, Festive Night is officially regarded as the 3rd iteration of the [Lorraine, Wandering Warrior sample cards](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples).*

This was the first card printed to feature <span class="dead-link">[Silvie](/champions#silvie)</span>, and the first card to include two champions in its artwork.

### Variants

Two foil variants of the Lorraine, Festive Night card were released together: <span class="dead-link">[star foil](/foil#star-foil)</span> and <span class="dead-link">[normal foil](/foil#normal-foil)</span>.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-24-lorraine-festive-night-samples/variants.png" description="Lorraine, Festive Night star foil (left) and normal foil (right)." %}

Star foil features a layer of holofoil star outlines of various shapes between the background and the two champions. Presumably as an oversight, the star foil pattern also covers the material cost and life count icons.

The developers later went on to publicly say that they weren't fond of the foil that had been applied to the Lorraine, Festive Night samples, saying that it was too much and took away from the artwork in general. 

### Distribution

Lorraine, Festive Night normal foil and star foil both have an official population of between 300 and 500 copies.

The normal foil card was given as a freebie to all [Champion Tier](/kickstarter#champion-tier), [Grand Champion](/kickstarter#grand-champion) and [Designer](/kickstarter#designer) Kickstarter backers (148 total), with an additional 100 backers chosen at random to receive the card.

Both the normal foil and star foil were given out individually in Discord events and content creator giveaways (see [Individual card giveaways](#individual-card-giveaways) below).

The star foil card also appears in [SAMPLE](/promotional-packs#identifier-code-sample) (1 in 3 chance) and [SAMPLE2](/promotional-packs#identifier-code-sample2) (1 in 6 chance) promotional packs.

### Individual card giveaways

This section notes events which directly awarded cards to winners/participants. This does not include cards distributed within [Promotional Packs](/promotional-packs), which has its own dedicated page.

#### Discord Giveaway #1: PnP 1.2 photo contest

On 7th January 2022 the developers announced released of version 1.2 of the Lorraine and Rai <span class="dead-link">[print and play](/print-and-play)</span> decks. To accompany this, they added an event asking people to take pictures of them playing with the cards they'd printed out.

In total, 20 people were selected on 15th January 2022 to receive the star foil variant.

#### Discord Giveaway #2: PnP 1.2 Tabletop Simulator play

Announced at the same time as the above photo contest, the developers were also looking for the community to play Grand Archive with one another using Tabletop Simulator. The developers would randomly jump into games being played on any of their Discord voice channels and award cards.

It's unknown how many copies were distributed in this way, but both the star foil variant and [Lorraine, Wandering Warrior (CMT-013) samples](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#cmt-013) were given out through this event.

#### Content Creator Giveaway #4
