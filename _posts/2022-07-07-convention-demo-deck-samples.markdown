*If you're looking for the regular card stock demo decks given to game stores and distributors, see [LGS Demo 2022 (DEMO22)](/DEMO22_(set)).*

## Introduction

On 26th May 2022, a couple of days before Grand Archive made an appearance at Collect-a-Con in Dallas, [Kickstarter update #22](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3487747) announced that anyone attending the convention could visit the Grand Archive booth to play a gameplay demo against one of the developers. Regardless of whether or not you beat the developer, you'd get to keep your demo deck

These demo decks were intended to be identical to the LGS Demo Decks the developers had announced on 11th March 2022 in [Kickstarter update #18](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3450881), however also noted in the 26th May update were issues with the cutting of the cards due to the thick card stock used.

The team decided that all future cards were to be printed on thinner card stock. As such these thick card stock convention demo decks were labelled as not legal for play and were unintentionally given sample card status.

When the finalised [LGS Demo 2022](/DEMO22_(set)) decks did release 6 months later in December 2022, some [changes](#differences) had been made.

### Kickstarter update excerpt

> In the last Kickstarter update, we shared our progress with our manufacturing samples. We were happy with the 7th iteration samples, and were calling it the final iteration of samples. However, after manufacturing thousands demo decks, **it has become apparent that a quality control issue exists that is related to the cutting of the cards.** We have identified that the issue was because the card stock we were using was too thick and was using a stiffer material than normal. We will continue testing with lower thickness card stocks in the coming weeks. 
>
> Because the card thickness will be lowering, the demo decks which were printed on thicker card stock, **will not be legal for organized play.** In addition, we printed some promotional cards such as an [alternative extended art of Dungeon Guide](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdLjxqJMRfT/) which is a card that was supposed to be included with merchandise sales. However, this was also using the thicker card stock, which means that this too will not be legal for organized play. Therefore, we have decided to not distribute this Dungeon Guide until we print it in its final form.  It was hard for us to compromise the card thickness to improve quality control, as we were very excited for thick cards. However, we believe that with other elements such has high detail printing and the frosted texture + UV spot treatment backs, our cards will still feel very premium. 
>
> These demo decks will not be distributed to local game stores through distributors. They will only be given away by the GA team from events. After solving the quality control issues, we will be reprinting the demo decks as real cards, which will then be distributed to stores. 

## Distribution

Before the developers made the decision to move on to thinner card stock, 12,000 of these thick card stock Demo Decks had been produced.

Starting with Collect-a-Con in Dallas, these 12,000 decks would be freely given out at conventions over the coming months whilst stocks lasted.

Convention | Decks distributed
:-- | :--
Collect-a-Con Dallas May 2022 | 1,000
Anime Expo Los Angeles July 2022 | 2,000
Future conventions (TBD) | 9,000

Whilst the original 26th May 2022 Kickstarter update noted that fans would only be able to keep the decks they had played against a developer with, in reality these decks were given out to anyone who asked for them.

## Variants

The cards included in the deck are always the same, but the packaging and other contents did change over time.

### Sealed

The first 1,000 decks distributed at the Dallas Collect-a-Con in May 2022 were all sealed in a clear plastic wrap.

The cards cannot be accessed without the seal being broken.

### Loose in bag

All other conventions from the Los Angeles Anime Expo in July 2022 onwards saw the decks loosely packaged in a clear plastic bag with a printed booklet - separating the material deck from the main deck - detailing the game setup, turn phases and card anatomy.

Unlike the [sealed variant](#sealed) above, these decks can be resealed without any indication that they have ever been opened.

## Deck contents

The sample Demo Decks are made up of 34 cards . The set list is [slightly different](#differences) to that of the final [LGS Demo 2022 (DEMO22)](/DEMO22_(set)) decks given to game stores and distributors in December 2022:

The quantity of each card reveals its overall population. With 12,000 decks distributed, cards with _x1_ have a population of 12,000, whilst _x2_ has a population of 24,000 and _x3_ has the highest population at 36,000.

## Differences

Compared with the final 19-card [LGS Demo 2022](/DEMO22_(set)) deck release, the sample deck has a total of 20 cards. [Lorraine, Blademaster](https://index.gatcg.com/edition/lorraine-blademaster-demo22) and [Banner Knight](https://index.gatcg.com/edition/banner-knight-demo22) make an appearance in the sample deck, with [Scry the Skies](https://index.gatcg.com/card/scry-the-skies) from the final release not included.

Lorraine, Blademaster adds a 3rd champion card to the sample decks. This version of the card is identical to that of the [Dawn of Ashes Prelude](/DOAp_(set)) release.

Banner Knight is also identical to that of the [Dawn of Ashes Prelude](/DOAp_(set)) version of the card.

## What about the cards with blank backs?

All of the cards within the demo decks given out at conventions had the normal gloss-treated Grand Archive card backs.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-07-07-convention-demo-deck-samples/card-back.png" description="Grand Archive card back." max-width="320px" %}

One of the activities at the Grand Archive booth at Anime Expo allowed anyone to create their own constructed decks using card-sized paper print outs of cards from the [Dawn of Ashes Prelude set](/DOAp_(set)). These were printed on regular printer paper.

If you want one of these blank back cards for yourself, check out the [Print and Play section of Grand Archive Index](https://index.gatcg.com/pnp) where you can generate identical-size cards that you can print yourself from home.

Despite being readily available for anyone to print themselves, at Anime Expo in Los Angeles several of these print outs were stolen from the Grand Archive booth which delayed people from taking part in the activity until more could be printed. Some of these stolen print outs later appeared for sale on eBay.
