## Introduction

Promotional Packs made their debut appearance on 19th March 2022.

In preparation for the Grand Archive Community Tournament #2, one of the developers shared a cropped image on the Grand Archive Discord server of the back of an empty pack with an identifier code of `17 MAR 2022`.

An extended version of this image was shared on 24th March 2022 in [Kickstarter update #20](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3462907).

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/2022-03-17-promo-pack.png" description="Promotional Pack image from Kickstarter update #20." %}

Promotional packs were to replace the individual cards the development team had been sending out in giveaways and events (as they had in [all previous events](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#before-19th-march-2022)).

The `17 MAR 2022` identifier turned out to be just an internal test and was not publicly released. The first promotional packs to make their way out into the public had the code [`SAMPLE`](#identifier-code-sample), followed shortly after by [`SAMPLE2`](#identifier-code-sample2) and [`SAMPLE3`](#identifier-code-sample3).

This article aims to cover everything known about various Promotional Pack releases.

## Black packs (March - November 2022)

All black promotional packs are identical in appearance but with designating identifiers printed on the back. The identifier code denotes the pack's contents. All black packs contain sample cards with the exception of [`P22 - 1`](#identifier-code-p22---1).

### Identifier code: `SAMPLE`

Also referred to as "SAMPLE1", this pack was only distributed during a single event, the [Grand Archive Community Tournament #2](grand-archive-community-tournament-2).

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/sample1.png" description="Grand Archive <code>SAMPLE</code> Promotional Pack scan." %}

#### Distribution

The `SAMPLE` code packs had a very small public distribution. On 26th March 2022, 19 packs were awarded in the Grand Archive Community Tournament #2, with a further 2 packs being awarded to the tournament's organiser.

A further 11 `SAMPLE` packs were advertised as the reward for the first Friday Night Grand Archive tournament on 15th April 2022, however by then the developers had introduced [new `SAMPLE2` packs](#identifier-code-sample2) and awarded those instead.

In total, only 21 `SAMPLE` packs are known to have been distributed.

### Identifier code: `SAMPLE2`

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/sample2.png" description="Grand Archive <code>SAMPLE2</code> Promotional Pack scan." %}

#### Distribution

On 1st April 2022 the first Friday Night Grand Archive tournament was announced with 8 [`SAMPLE` code packs](#identifier-code-sample) advertised as the reward. However by 15th April when the event went ahead, `SAMPLE2` packs had been introduced by the developers and they instead awarded those. In total, 8 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded at this event, with a further 10 `SAMPLE2` packs given as a surprise reward to the participants.

50 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 30th April 2022 randomly on Discord to people who had left comments on cards featured on [Grand Archive Index](https://index.gatcg.com).

20 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 8th May 2022 to winners of a Guess the Art event on Discord.

8 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 13th May 2022 during the second Friday Night Grand Archive tournament, with 3 packs going to the winner, 2 packs to 2nd place, 1 pack for 3rd and 4th place and 1 pack randomly awarded to a participant outside of the top 4.

16 `SAMPLE2` packs were given out at Collect-a-Con on 29th May 2022 during [a live stream event](https://www.dripshop.live/grand-archive-debut-event-kickstarter-giveaways-qanda-with-the?referral=TofusTrading) hosted by TofusTrading.

15 `SAMPLE2` packs were given out over a 3 week period from 20th June 2022 by [Maindeck](https://www.maindeck.games) during a Grand Archive league on their Discord server sponsored by the developers.

20 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 28th June 2022 randomly during a Silvie Emote event on Discord.

### Identifier code: `SAMPLE3`

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/sample3.png" description="Grand Archive <code>SAMPLE3</code> Promotional Pack scan." %}

#### Contents

- <small>[33.33%]</small> [Lorraine, Wandering Warrior (<small>DOAp 1st &middot; EN-000 C</small>) foil sample](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#doap-1st--en-000-c)

#### Distribution

Approximately 200 `SAMPLE3` packs were given out at Collect-a-Con in May 2022.

### Identifier code: `P22 - 1`

`P22 - 1` was the first time Promotional Packs had been used to distribute non-sample cards. The cards in `SAMPLE`, `SAMPLE2` and `SAMPLE3` are not legal for play, but the cards awarded from `P22 - 1` packs are printed on finalized card stock and - despite being released a couple of months before the [Dawn of Ashes First Edition](/DOA-1st_(set)) set was distributed - are legal for play and not regarded as samples.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/p22-1.png" description="Grand Archive Clumsy Apprentice Promotional Pack scan." %}

#### Contents

- <small>[87.5%]</small> [Dungeon Guide (<small>P22 &middot; EN-001 PR</small>)](https://index.gatcg.com/edition/dungeon-guide-p22)
- <small>[12.5%]</small> [Dungeon Guide (<small>P22 &middot; EN-001 PR</small>) foil](https://index.gatcg.com/edition/dungeon-guide-p22)

#### Distribution

The developers stated publicly that the Dungeon Guide promo would have 2,100 non-foil and 300 foil copies, however only 1,200 non-foil and 150 foil were eventually distributed. This results in a total of 1,350 `P22 - 1` code packs in circulation.

Approximately 480 packs were distributed at Anime Expo in July 2022, with the remainder distributed at Anime Matsuri, Anime Houston and Collect-A-Con Long Beach throughout summer 2022, and as part of separate Discord chat bot and merchandise events.

## Promotional packs

In December 2022 the Grand Archive developers moved away from the black pack with identifier code design and introduced a new silver pack design which clearly denotes the packs contents on the front.

### Clumsy Apprentice

An article [published on the Grand Archive website](https://www.gatcg.com/article/upcoming-promotional-cards) on 14th October 2022 listed 4 upcoming promotional cards in the P22 set. For the Clumsy Apprentice card, they alluded to the changed pack design without revealing any more:

> You will be able to find Clumsy Apprentice promotional packs at our upcoming event, Anime Frontier! These promotional packs will be replacing the previous Dungeon Guide packs we have been including with merch sales.

It was during Anime Frontier on 2nd December when these packs started to be handed out that we saw what these new packs looked like.

#### Distribution

Packs were originally distributed at Anime Frontier between 2nd and 4th December 2022 to anyone who spent $40 or more on merchandise. Every $40 spent would result in a Clumsy Apprentice pack being thrown in for free.

This merchandise event extended to Discord in January 2023, similarly to the previous [`P22 - 1`](#identifier-code-p22---1) packs, for anyone to participate in during a 36 hour window.

Two packs were also bundled in with <span class="dead-link">[Grand Archive Ambassador Bundles](/ambassador-bundle)</span> for anyone lucky enough to receive one of those.

Most of them contain a single Rare (R) or Super Rare (SR) non-foil or any rarity foil from the main set that was the current meta during the pack's release. They have a rare chance of instead containing a Collector Promo Rare (CPR) from the [Event Packs (EVP)](/EVP_(set)) set.

#### 'Not Intended for Resale' Dawn of Ashes Event Packs

The [Dawn of Ashes Event Packs article](https://www.gatcg.com/article/dawn-of-ashes-event-packs) on the Grand Archive website includes a scan of silver and gold Dawn of Ashes Event Packs, however unlike the ones [mentioned earlier](#dawn-of-ashes-event-pack) these feature the "Not Intended for Resale" label instead of "For Events Only".

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/doa-evp-unreleased.png" description="'Not Intended for Resale' Dawn of Ashes Event Packs." max-width="500px" %}
