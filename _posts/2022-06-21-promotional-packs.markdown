## Introduction

On 19th March 2022 Promotional Packs made their debut appearance.

In preparation for the [Grand Archive Community Tournament #2](#grand-archive-community-tournament-2), one of the developers shared a cropped image on the Grand Archive Discord server of the back of an empty pack with an identifier code of `17 MAR 2022`, explaining that winners of the tournaments would receive promotional packs instead of loose cards (as they had [in all previous events](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#before-19th-march-2022)).

The `17 MAR 2022` identifier turned out to be just an internal test and was not publicly released. The first promotional packs to make their way out into the public had the code `SAMPLE`, followed by `SAMPLE2` and `SAMPLE3`.



## Pack list

All promotional packs are identical in appearance. The identifier code specifically denotes the pack's contents. Unlike before where winners of giveaways would be awarded a specific card, these packs would contain one card at random from a pool of cards.

This list aims to cover everything known about various Promotional Pack releases.

### Identifier code: `SAMPLE`

This pack was only distributed during a single event, the [Grand Archive Community Tournament #2](grand-archive-community-tournament-2).

## Giveaways

### Grand Archive Community Tournament #2

On 11th March 2022 the second Grand Archive Community Tournament was announced. This tournament used the new version 1.3 of the Print and Play Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks, and was held 2 weeks later on 26th March.

It was between the announcement of this tournament that [promotional packs](promotional-packs) were introduced, with the developers initially sharing a picture of a pack with an identifier code of `17 MAR 2022`. However this was an internal sample, and the tournament itself would award packs with the `SAMPLE` identifier code instead.

This tournament awarded - amongst other things - 3 promotional packs to the 1st place player, 2 packs to the 2nd place player, and 1 pack to each of the 3rd through 8th place players. 4 additional packs were awarded randomly to the participants who didn't finish within the top 8, and an additional 4 packs were given away randomly to viewers of the tournament stream.

This was the only event which saw `SAMPLE` packs being awarded before being replaced by `SAMPLE2`, introducing the updated [17 life Lorraine, Wandering Warrior](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#doap-1st--en-000-c).

### Friday Night Grand Archive Online Event

On 1st April 2022 a side tournament was organised on the Grand Archive Discord by one of the community moderators. This tournament also used version 1.3 of the Print and Play Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks, and was held two weeks later on 15th April.

The reward for this tournament was publicly documented as `SAMPLE` packs awarded to the top 4 players, however when it came to distributing the awards `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded instead in a similar fashion to the community tournament: 3 packs were awarded to the 1st place player, 2 for 2nd place and 1 pack for the 3rd and 4th place players. An additional pack was also randomly awarded to one of the participants who didn't finish within the top 4.
