## Introduction

Promotional Packs made their debut appearance on 19th March 2022.

In preparation for the Grand Archive Community Tournament #2, one of the developers shared a cropped image on the Grand Archive Discord server of the back of an empty pack with an identifier code of `17 MAR 2022`.

An extended version of this image was shared on 24th March 2022 in [Kickstarter update #20](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3462907).

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-21-promotional-packs/2022-03-17-promo-pack.png" description="Promotional Pack image from Kickstarter update #20." %}

Promotional packs were to replace the individual cards the development team had been sending out in giveaways and events (as they had in [all previous events](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#before-19th-march-2022)).

The `17 MAR 2022` identifier turned out to be just an internal test and was not publicly released. The first promotional packs to make their way out into the public had the code [`SAMPLE`](#identifier-code-sample), followed shortly after by [`SAMPLE2`](#identifier-code-sample2) and [`SAMPLE3`](#identifier-code-sample3).

## Distribution

This section provides a brief overview of how many of each of the Grand Archive promotional packs have been produced.

Pack code | <small>Population</small> | Release date
:-- | :-- | :--
[`SAMPLE`](#identifier-code-sample) | 21 | 26th March 2022
[`SAMPLE2`](#identifier-code-sample2) | >= 147 | 15th April 2022
[`SAMPLE3`](#identifier-code-sample3) | > 200 | 28th May 2022
[`P22`](#identifier-code-p22) | 2,400 | 1st July 2022


## Pack list

All promotional packs are identical in appearance. The identifier code specifically denotes the pack's contents. Unlike before where winners of giveaways would be awarded a specific card, these packs would contain one card at random from a pool of cards.

This list aims to cover everything known about various Promotional Pack releases.

### Identifier code: `SAMPLE`

Also referred to as "SAMPLE1", this pack was only distributed during a single event, the [Grand Archive Community Tournament #2](grand-archive-community-tournament-2).

#### Distribution

The `SAMPLE` code packs had a very small public distribution. On 26th March 2022, 19 packs were awarded in the Grand Archive Community Tournament #2, with a further 2 packs being awarded to the tournament's organiser.

A further 11 `SAMPLE` packs were advertised as the reward for the first Friday Night Grand Archive tournament on 15th April 2022, however by then the developers had introduced [new `SAMPLE2` packs](#identifier-code-sample2) and awarded those instead.

In total, only 21 `SAMPLE` packs are known to have been distributed.

#### Distribution

On 1st April 2022 the first Friday Night Grand Archive tournament was announced with 8 [`SAMPLE` code packs](#identifier-code-sample) advertised as the reward. However by 15th April when the event went ahead, `SAMPLE2` packs had been introduced by the developers and they instead awarded those. In total, 8 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded at this event, with a further 10 `SAMPLE2` packs given as a surprise reward to the participants.

50 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 30th April 2022 randomly on Discord to people who had left comments on cards featured on [Grand Archive Index](https://index.gatcg.com).

20 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 8th May 2022 to winners of a Guess the Art event on Discord.

8 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 13th May 2022 during the second Friday Night Grand Archive tournament, with 3 packs going to the winner, 2 packs to 2nd place, 1 pack for 3rd and 4th place and 1 pack randomly awarded to a participant outside of the top 4.

16 `SAMPLE2` packs were given out at Collect-a-Con on 29th May 2022 during [a live stream event](https://www.dripshop.live/grand-archive-debut-event-kickstarter-giveaways-qanda-with-the?referral=TofusTrading) hosted by TofusTrading.

15 `SAMPLE2` packs were given out over a 3 week period from 20th June 2022 by [Maindeck](https://www.maindeck.games) during a Grand Archive league on their Discord server sponsored by the developers.

20 `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded on 28th June 2022 randomly during a Silvie Emote event on Discord.

### Identifier code: `SAMPLE3`

#### Distribution

Several hundred `SAMPLE3` packs were given out at Collect-a-Con in May 2022.

### Identifier code: `P22 - 1`

`P22 - 1` was the first time Promotional Packs had been used to distribute non-sample cards. The cards in `SAMPLE`, `SAMPLE2` and `SAMPLE3` are not legal for play, but the cards awarded from `P22 - 1` packs are printed on finalized card stock and - despite being released a couple of months before the <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes First Edition](/DOA_(set))</span> set was distributed - are legal for play and not regarded as samples.

#### Contents

- <small>[87.5%]</small> <span class="dead-link">[Dungeon Guide _<small>P22 &middot; EN-000 C</small>_ alternative artwork non-foil](/dungeon-guide_(card)#p22--en-000-c)</span>

#### Distribution

The developers stated publicly that the Dungeon Guide promo would have 2,100 non-foil and 300 foil copies. This results in a total of 2,400 `P22 - 1` code packs distributed.

Approximately 480 packs were distributed at Anime Expo in July 2022.

<!-- ## Giveaways

### Grand Archive Community Tournament #2

On 11th March 2022 the second Grand Archive Community Tournament was announced. This tournament used the new version 1.3 of the Print and Play Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks, and was held 2 weeks later on 26th March.

It was between the announcement of this tournament that [promotional packs](promotional-packs) were introduced, with the developers initially sharing a picture of a pack with an identifier code of `17 MAR 2022`. However this was an internal sample, and the tournament itself would award packs with the `SAMPLE` identifier code instead.

This tournament awarded - amongst other things - 3 promotional packs to the 1st place player, 2 packs to the 2nd place player, and 1 pack to each of the 3rd through 8th place players. 4 additional packs were awarded randomly to the participants who didn't finish within the top 8, and an additional 4 packs were given away randomly to viewers of the tournament stream.

This was the only event which saw `SAMPLE` packs being awarded before being replaced by `SAMPLE2`, introducing the updated [17 life Lorraine, Wandering Warrior](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#doap-1st--en-000-c).

### Friday Night Grand Archive Online Event

On 1st April 2022 a side tournament was organised on the Grand Archive Discord by one of the community moderators. This tournament also used version 1.3 of the Print and Play Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks, and was held two weeks later on 15th April.

The reward for this tournament was publicly documented as `SAMPLE` packs awarded to the top 4 players, however when it came to distributing the awards `SAMPLE2` packs were awarded instead in a similar fashion to the community tournament: 3 packs were awarded to the 1st place player, 2 for 2nd place and 1 pack for the 3rd and 4th place players. An additional pack was also randomly awarded to one of the participants who didn't finish within the top 4. -->
