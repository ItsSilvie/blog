excerpt: Grand Archive's developers were keen to involve the community in play testing very early on, often before card artwork had been imagined. Doodle art brought these cards to life.

## Print and Play

Unlike some Kickstarter-funded TCGs, Grand Archive was not a finished product when the Kickstarter launched. The gameplay and rules had been mostly thought out, but most of the cards were missing artwork.

To introduce the fans to the game and receive feedback on the gameplay mechanics and balance, the developers created Lorraine and Rai <span class="dead-link">[print and play decks](/print-and-play)</span>. These were originally only provided to select community members, but on 3rd December 2021 these were made public for everyone to use.

Versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 all featured doodle art, but with every new version more and more of the artworks had been replaced with something closer to the final design. With the introduction of version 1.3, no doodle artworks remained.

## Card previews on Discord

In March 2022 one of the Grand Archive developers shared some previously unseen doodle artwork:

## April Fool's Day 2022

Doodle artwork was becoming a distant memory when April 2022 rolled around. As a tribute to the older doodle artworks included in the early versions of the <span class="dead-link">[print and play decks](/print-and-play)</span>, on April 1st 2022 the Grand Archive team [shared this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb0Hm7atEX4):

Numbered as [APR 1st &middot; EN-000 C](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples#apr-1st--en-000-c), this one was illustrated by Silvie &mdash; here's to hoping she graces us with more of her talent in future.
