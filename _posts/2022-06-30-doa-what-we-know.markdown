## Introduction

Ever since the Kickstarter campaign launched in November 2021, the Grand Archive developers have been trickling previews of upcoming cards on social media. Starting with cards from the [Dawn of Ashes Prelude](/DOAp_(set)) set (which has been since fully revealed), the majority of these card previews have been labelled `DOA TEST CARD`.

Over the past month, however, we've been seeing cards with actual numbers relating to their position within Dawn of Ashes set.

Following a few social media posts, in June 2022 we saw Maindeck's [Tristan, Grim Stalker reveal](https://www.maindeck.games/grand-archive-tcg-set-1-exclusive-previews/) followed by Red Zone Rogue's [Merlin, Memory Thief reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZE-LyNr3kk), then Sera and Triskit's <span class="dead-link">[Designer Tier](/kickstarter#designer-tier)</span> [Triskit, Guidance Angel reveal](https://youtu.be/QEGxmeosglE).

At the end of the month, on 29th June, the [Grand Archive website](https://gatcg.com) received a major update which included dozens of additional numbered cards. The set has yet to be revealed in full - and is something we likely won't know until September - but for now we can piece together what has been shared.

## Set variants

Dawn of Ashes is split into two separate main sets: <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes First Edition](/DOA-1st_(set))</span> and <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes Alter Edition](/DOA_(set))</span>. In terms of numbering, cards from the First Edition set are labelled `DOA 1st` and cards from the Alter Edition set are labelled `DOA`.

Cards from the Dawn of Ashes Starter Decks are labelled `DOASD`.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-30-doa-what-we-know/alter-edition-product.png" description="Alter Edition product image." %}

There are two main differences between First Edition and Alter Edition:

* First Edition has 12 <span class="dead-link">[Collector Super Rare (CSR)](/rarity#csr)</span> cards compared to only 4 in Alter Edition;
* Alter Edition does not feature foil versions of the 12 mainline champion cards whereas First Edition does.

In total, this means that Dawn of Ashes has:

* 275 unique cards (excluding <span class="dead-link">[CSR](/rarity#csr)</span>)
* 268 foil cards in First Edition and 260 foil cards in Alter Edition
* 12 cards per pack
* 24 packs per box
* 6 boxes per case
