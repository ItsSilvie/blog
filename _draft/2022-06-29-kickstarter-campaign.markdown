excerpt: Grand Archive's developers were keen to involve the community in play testing very early on, often before card artwork had been imagined. Doodle art brought these cards to life.

## History

The [Grand Archive Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg) was pre-launched on 21st October 2021 and officially ran from 17th November 2021 at 8PM (CST) to 1st January 2022 at 1PM (CST).

Only promoted through word of mouth, Grand Archive was one of few start-up trading card games to appear on Kickstarter that hadn't already built up a large community and didn't already have a ready-to-ship product through prior funding. What it did have was over a year of effort put into the gameplay mechanics between developers <span class="dead-link">[Alan Phan](/developers#alan-phan)</span> and <span class="dead-link">[Hung Ly](/developers#hung-ly)</span>.

With a modest $50,000 goal, the Kickstarter launch in November 2021 revealed a trading card game that had an extensive amount of time and thought put into it.

With a mix of anime artwork and western game design, right from the get go there was something for both competitive players and collectors to get excited about, and it wasn't long before [Grand Archive's Discord server](https://discord.gg/grandarchivetcg) - opened on the same day as the Kickstarter pre-launch - became a hive of activity.

Less than an hour after the Kickstarter campaign went live, the $50,000 pledge goal had already been blown out of the water. After the first 24 hours the project was at $589,204, over ten times its goal.

<span class="dead-link">[Print and play](/print-and-play)</span> versions of the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks were launched during the Kickstarter campaign to introduce everyone to the gameplay whilst providing invaluable feedback to the developers.

With an extensive game guide and set of rules, small tournaments were also set up awarding [Lorraine, Wandering Warrior (sample)](/lorraine-wandering-warrior-samples) and [Lorraine, Festive Night (sample)](/lorraine-festive-night-samples) cards.

### Designer

The Designer Tier pledge was $10,000 and was limited to only 1 backer.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-29-kickstarter-campaign/designer-tier.png" description="Designer Tier Kickstarter graphic." %}

By far the most lucrative tier, the Designer Tier also included the design of a custom <span class="dead-link">[Ally](/types#ally)</span> card to be included in the main <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes](/DOA_(set))</span> set.

The Designer Tier was taken almost immediately after the campaign launched, however in early December the original backer dropped out and someone else was quick to take it.

That someone else turned out to be a duo: Sera and Triskit, who collaboratively worked with <span class="dead-link">[Hori](/illustrators#hori)</span> to design <span class="dead-link">[Triskit, Guidance Angel](/triskit-guidance-angel)</span>, first revealed in a video [uploaded by Triskit on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEGxmeosglE) on 29th June 2022.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/2022-06-29-kickstarter-campaign/triskit-guidance-angel.png" description="Triskit, Guidance Angel digital image." max-width="400px" %}

This was the first time the community had seen a card using the <span class="dead-link">[Luxem](/elements#luxem)</span> element, the first time a card had been seen which enabled multiple elements at once, and the first time an Ally card had been seen with the ability to take the place of the active Champion.

### Brick and Mortar Game Store Tiers

Two tiers were set up specifically for brick and mortar game stores. Backers were required to verify that they operated a game store from a physical location.

Both tiers offered discounted add-on prices, with Starter Kits at $35 ($5 off) and booster boxes at $66 ($24 off).

#### Game Store Tier 1
