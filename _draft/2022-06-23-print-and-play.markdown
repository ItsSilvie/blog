## Introduction

Unlike some Kickstarter-funded TCGs, Grand Archive was not printed and ready to ship before the Kickstarter launched. There was no finalised product and backers would knowingly have to wait 9+ months until their booster boxes would be shipped out to them.

To introduce the fans to the game and receive feedback on the gameplay mechanics and balance, the developers created Lorraine and Rai print and play decks. These were originally only provided to select community members, but on 3rd December 2021 these were made public for everyone to use in an announcement [on Kickstarter update #4](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3377501).

These print and play decks - as the name suggests - allowed anyone to simply print out a set of pages containing images of all of the cards in each deck (even in their unfinished [doodle art](/doodle-art) state), which could be cut up and played with as if they were the real cards.

With an accompanying Grand Archive TCG Quick Start Guide [shared on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r74jMgARJL4), a rough set of rules and a game guide in PDF format, and Dan Green of [Maindeck](https://www.maindeck.games) providing a [gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PauzSCV35Ow), keen TCG players could quickly jump straight into the action.

This allowed backers to have a taste of what Grand Archive was like whilst also providing invaluable feedback to the development team on the mechanics and balance of the two decks.

Print and play decks are designed for unofficial usage only and are not legal for use in official Grand Archive tournaments.

## The Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks

The two print and play decks centred around a <span class="dead-link">[Wind](/elements#wind)</span>/<span class="dead-link">[Warrior](/classes#warrior)</span> Lorraine deck tailored towards aggro and mid-range combat, and a <span class="dead-link">[Fire](/elements#fire)</span>/<span class="dead-link">[Mage](/classes#mage)</span> Rai deck tailored towards combo attacks and control.

{% include blockquote.html quote="Lorraine is an aspiring swordsman who hones her edge and raises her blade for the sake of justice. Her deck includes a multitude of weapons and attacks that she uses to defeat her opponents as well as many strong allies that answer to her call and protect her. Amass your army and attack your opponent’s champion! However, beware of mages. They might defeat your allies one by one or destroy your army entirely! Keep up your advance and don’t let them prepare their destructive spells!" author="Lorraine deck introduction" %}

{% include blockquote.html quote="Rai is a curious mage whose desire for knowledge knows no bounds. His deck includes many strong spells that he can use to increase his power and defeat his enemies, as well as reliable allies that can protect him. Become enlightened in the pursuit of magic and unleash devastating spells that lay waste on the battlefield! Beware of swordsmen whose advent of strikes may delay your preparations and warriors whose strong fortitudes are resistant to your magic. Maintain your concentration and have faith in the arcane!" author="Rai deck introduction" %}

## PnP Version 1.0

The first iteration of the print and play decks was publicly released on 3rd December 2021. This was the same version provided privately to select community members before that date. It introduced the <span class="dead-link">[Lorraine](/champions#lorraine-allard)</span> and <span class="dead-link">[Rai](/champions#rai-kyouki)</span> print and play decks, along with a lot of previously unseen cards.

It relied heavily on unpolished and [doodle artwork](/doodle-art) as the developers were busy focusing on the gameplay itself at this point.

### Feedback from players

The general vibe from players at this point was that the game was a bit too slow and unbalanced in Rai's favor. Rai's ability to easily remove Lorraine's allies made those often ineffective and it turned into a back and forth of turn passing.

## PnP Version 1.1

On 18th December 2021 version 1.1 of the print and play decks was launched in [Kickstarter update #6](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3388206).

### Changes

1. Whilst keeping to the theme of Grand Archive being a slower-paced TCG, in response to feedback from players that they were running out of cards to play too quickly version 1.1 introduced the <span class="dead-link">[Floating Memory](/card-effects#floating-memory)</span> keyword, allowing cards to be banished from players' graveyards to pay for memory costs;
2. Lorraine's attack cards were buffed in response to players finding Lorraine to be too weak;
3. Lorraine vs. Lorraine and Rai vs. Rai games presented difficult situations. To remedy this, some new cards were added whilst others were nerfed;
4. Rai players had to spend a lot of turns setting up before being effective. For this, Rai's allies were made to be more threatening;
5. It didn't feel worth it levelling Lorraine to level 3. In response to this the <span class="dead-link">[Crux](/elements#crux)</span> cards were buffed and level 3 was made to be more accessible;
6. Rai's focus on combo was something players found complicated to use. To address this,
