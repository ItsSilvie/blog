This is an archive of the Grand Archive Kickstarter updates.

The purpose of this article is to preserve a history of the updates in the event the [Grand Archive Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/description) becomes unavailable or if their [Kickstarter updates](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts) get removed.

**This is not a live feed.** If you're looking for the latest Kickstarter update, it may not be archived on this page yet. As such you should always check the Grand Archive Kickstarter page for the latest updates relating to the campaign.

## Update #1 <small>&ndash; 19th November 2021</small>

[Grand Archive TCG Kickstarter Update #1!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3363728)

> _Hello all, this is Alan from the Grand Archive Team!_
>
> _First off, on behalf of the team, I'd like to thank all of you for your tremendous support and faith in our project. You guys completely blew us out of the water, and we are honored and tremendously thankful for your support! In saying that, welcome to the first update for the Grand Archive TCG._

>
> The first thing we'd like to update you guys about is the stretch goals! As you all have seen, you guys absolutely crushed the goals we had set initially.  We have added another stretch goal. We hope you guys like it and feel free to ask any questions, we would be happy to answer.  With that being said, we would like to take a longer time to decide any further stretch goals. The amount of funds you guys have raised is phenomenal and it's something we do not take lightly. As a small team and a new and upcoming game, the number one thing we **DON'T** want to do is make false promises and set unrealistic goals for ourselves.
>
> Grand Archive started as a passion project between a group of close friends that share the same interests. We want to grow with this community, and we will show you our commitment to making Grand Archive last. We won't take the amount of faith you all have put in us for granted, and we will make you proud to be part of the group that got Grand Archive off its feet.

> We have heard your voices and have read your messages. We understand that there is concern with the dynamic print run. However, we are firm on our stance on this. There is a maximum of 20,000 boxes that could be printed based on Kickstarter. However, when Kickstarter ends, regardless of what happens in the future, or how the number changes, there will **NOT** be any more Dawn of Ashes First Edition boxes printed. At this current moment, there are 8,897 booster boxes to be printed. Whatever number that is by the time Kickstarter ends, will be it for Dawn of Ashes First Edition. Once the campaign is over the only way to get Dawn of Ashes is through the unlimited product line or from the secondary market.
>
> Speaking of unlimited products, we have decided we need to redo how we are releasing unlimited editions. Many people have voiced their opinions on when unlimited should come out, and upon further contemplation, we have decided that instead of unlimited edition coming out at the same time,  unlimited edition will now come out at least one month later than first edition. This is based on the feedback and advice given to us by our community in discord, local game stores, and distributors that we have talked to. We realize there needs to be more time in between these products and it would be foolish to disregard the advice given to us. Pre-Orders for Dawn of Ashes unlimited edition product will be live after their first edition counterpart releases. We are still committed to making the product accessible to players. We will be closely monitoring this upon release of first edition products.
>
> We feel that this will be fair, and our ears are open to additional feedback on this. We hope you respect our decision, as we do yours!
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/01-img-4.png)
>
>  We've added this question into our FAQ, but the game store tier is for brick and mortar LGSs only. We apologize to online retailers, but we stand firm on this decision. We want to grow a community within physical stores and believe this decision will help with organized play in the future. 
>
> Thank you for reading this update! We love this community, and we will make you proud!

## Update #2 <small>&ndash; 24th November 2021</small>

[Grand Archive TCG Kickstarter Update #2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3367802)

> Hello everyone! It's Alan and I'm here with another update for you guys! I can't believe we've raised even more since the last update, you guys are incredible. Let's get started with the update!
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/02-img-1.png)
>
> This week we will be releasing the comprehensive rulebook and game guide for Grand Archive TCG! This should be released on another Kickstarter update on Friday.  We hope this gives you guys more insight to the game, and will be more useful when we have the print and play out. 
>
> Speaking of the print and play, that's coming too! We are testing it internally and hope to have it out soon. This will allow eager community members to test out Grand Archive TCG with a buddy as long as they're willing to print the decks out and do some cutting. Just to note, these print and play decks have placeholder art doodled on by the developers, and are for gameplay testing purposes only. We'll be providing these print and plays out to select community members first as an additional round of testing before releasing it fully to the public. Stay tuned for that!
>
> We've also heard from the community to look into Tabletop Simulator and we think this is a great idea! We would like to reach out to our community and see if anyone would be able to help us this project! Send me an inquiry on discord @Aldeus#3532, or at alanp@weebsoftheshore.com and let's talk!
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/02-img-2.png)
>
> This is kind of an interesting topic, we were told about Pax Unplugged in Philadelphia and I think this is a great opportunity to go out and check out what else the scene has to offer! We found out really late, so I will just be there as an attendee. This means no booth or anything, but I am inviting you guys to come and hang out with me and potentially other Grand Archive team members to play Grand Archive! I'll bring extra decks with me and duel with some of you there in the community / open gaming area. We hope to record some gameplay and put it on YouTube and on our page, so please keep that in mind if you are not comfortable with that.
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/02-img-3.png)
>
> We are reaching out to all content creators! Do you have a podcast you'd like to talk on? Or are you interested in doing a video interview with me from the Grand Archive Team? I am completely open to any ideas you may have, so please reach out to me at alanp@weebsoftheshore.com, or on discord at Aldeus#3532. I’d also like to take some  time to shout out to some content creators in the community! First shoutout is to Dan Green from MetaManiacs, and next is KitchenTableTCG for letting me have a conversation with them on their respective channels! It was a lot of fun and I hope to talk to more content creators soon!
>
> #### Samples Disclaimer
>
> A lot of people have been sharing the pictures of samples which is great! However, we want to remind you that these are not indicative of what the final cards will look like. We are still testing with multiple manufacturers and it is unlikely that the final rendition of Grand Archive cards will be the same as the samples some members of the community received. 
>
> If you're interested in getting a sample card, join our discord server ([discord.gg/grandarchivetcg](https://discord.gg/grandarchivetcg)) ! We've been doing events there as means to interact with the community, and you might be able to get yourself a sample card as a reward! 
>
>  A couple of people have been asking what the foiling for CRs might look like. We've posted this video on our discord and Instagram, but figure we should share this here too. This is just a sample, not indicative of the final version!

> #### Closing Remarks
>
> That's all for now! What else would you guys like to see? Leave it in the comments and I'll see you in the next update!

## Update #3 <small>&ndash; 26th November 2021</small>

[Grand Archive TCG Kickstarter Update #3](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3371368)

> Hey guys! I’m Chris, the newest member of the team for Grand Archive. I’ll be primarily helping the team with game design. You can find me on the discord as Nahgg#4582.
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/03-img-1.png)
>
> First off, I’d like to introduce the Game Guide and the Comprehensive Rules for Grand Archive. These documents will serve two purposes: Game Guide will serve as a how-to-play document that should give players a good idea for the structure of the game and the Comprehensive Rules will have nuanced language to describe formatting and all of the mechanics within the game. The Game Guide is the primary document for players wanting to learn the game and will go more in-depth than the quick-start guide videos you may have seen on our Kickstarter page. The Comprehensive Rules should be referenced primarily to solve rules questions, legality infractions, or to gain specific knowledge regarding particular rulings, interactions, and cases within the game. We’ll do our best to keep these documents updated as we keep playtesting and working on the game design and you’ll be able to see when each document was updated.

> **For the Game Guide, click [here](http://grandarchivetcg.com/game-guide.pdf).**
>
> **For the Comprehensive Rules, click [here](http://grandarchivetcg.com/comp-rules.pdf).**

> ...

Note: The particular versions of the Game Guide and Comprehensive Rules linked in this update have been archived separately in <span class="dead-link">[PnP Version 1.0 - Archived documents](/print-and-play#archived-documents)</span>.

> ...
>
> Feel free to look over them and, if you have any questions, ask them in our new [discord ](http://discord.gg/grandarchivetcg)rules-help channel! I’ll be available and try to answer questions as much as I can regarding these documents and will definitely take any feedback you guys may have. Shout out to Dan Green who has helped us review the documents and give us feedback; he’s been a great help! 
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/03-img-2.png)
>
> Second, regarding our campaign, we’d like to thank everyone for your support and constant feedback. We’re thrilled about having such an interactive community and hope you’ll continue to support us as we get closer and closer to reaching our goals for the game and its eventual release. As mentioned in our previous update this week, we plan to initially roll out Print and Play for select members in the community to test out. We know many have been interested in hosting webcam games and creating gameplay videos with what we have for them! We will be selecting community members to try the Print and Play as early as next week, and aim to have this fully available to everyone the following week. As a disclaimer, many cards included in this Print and Play have placeholder artwork that have been doodled on by the developers and is in no form indicative of what the final art will look like!  We’re super excited to have you all test what we’ve come up with so far for the two Starter Decks. 
>

>
> The third part of this update will address where we are in development, primarily in regards to the game design. We’ve been seeing discussion in the community regarding anticipation for how much of Dawn of Ashes has actually been created. While we’ve been continuously working on design for this set with the planned initial 3 classes of Mage, Warrior, and Tamer, we had not anticipated such massive support from the community for the project. We had not initially planned to develop a 4th class for Dawn of Ashes, however, in light of your support, we added a stretch goal for this. We do not yet know what the 4th class will be; that will be determined by you! With considerations towards the Dawn of Ashes set, a 4th class will have implications mechanically for the set as whole, particularly in regards to the drafting of the set. As such, it is likely that at least some part of the set will be redesigned with the inclusion of this 4th class. To sum things up, although most aspects of Mage, Warrior, and Tamer class have been completed for the Dawn of Ashes set, we still have a lot of work ahead of us with how this 4th class will affect the other classes and the entire set as a whole. We are doing a lot of preliminary designing for Assassin, Guardian, Ranger, and Cleric to prepare for this!

> In the meantime, thank you for your continued support and interest in Grand Archive! We’ll see you in the next update! Comment your thoughts below and join us in our [discord](http://discord.gg/grandarchivetcg)!

## Update #4 <small>&ndash; 3rd December 2021</small>

> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/04-img-1.png)

> For this Kickstarter update, we’re mainly going to discuss Print and Play! As many of you know, we previously released print and player to some members of the community. Some of you might have seen gameplay videos posted or even seen some of the discord members host webcam games. Given the positive feedback, we’ve decided to advance the public release of print and play! You can find the link for downloading the documents here.

>
> **What's next?** The next step for us is to revamp our website and Kickstarter page to feature all of the new cards that have been revealed recently on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/grandarchivetcg/)! 
>
> Also, our team will be at PAX unplugged as attendees! If you are attending, come find us and play a couple games of Grand Archive with us!

## Update #5 <small>&ndash; 9th December 2021</small>

[Grand Archive TCG Kickstarter Update #5 (TTS Release)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3377774)

> Hey guys! For this update, we’d mainly like to cover the Tabletop Simulator mod for Grand Archive made by Chris/Akumas in our Discord! This is currently perhaps the best way to enjoy the print and play for starter decks digitally at this time.
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/05-img-1.png)
>
> You can check out the mod here! Subscribe to the mod using your steam account to add it to your client.
>
> (link [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2672490874](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2672490874))
>
> For this mod, you can select any of the Lorraine or Rai starter decks and drag them to the appropriate zones. Before starting a game, don’t forget to shuffle the decks and assign yourself to a team at the top right! Chris/Akumas has also included a computer pad in-game with useful links to our rules document and play guide so that you and your opponent can both learn to play.
>
> [Click here to see archived image](/assets/images/2022-06-25-kickstarter-update-archive/05-img-2.png)
>
> Some useful shortcuts: 
>
> * Pressing R while hovering over a deck or stack of cards will shuffle them for you. Hovering over a stack of cards and pressing a number will draw that many (be careful since hitting two numbers in quick succession will treat it as a double-digit number). 
> * You can use Q and E to rotate a selected card or group of cards (to represent rest/awake status). F will flip cards over.
> * Pressing delete while hovering over an object will remove it from the game (useful if you want to reset the board or want to get rid of anything extra). 
> * You can highlight multiple cards by clicking and dragging a box around and, if you shake the cursor, it will group up the cards in a single stack. 
> * Hovering over a card and pressing the alt-key will enlarge the text box for you to read it more clearly. Alt-shift will peek at cards that are face down if you need to glimpse. 
> * You can find other commands with right-clicking a stack of cards, such as using the “search” function for the materials deck.
>
> Other functions will hopefully be added over time to increase usability including random banish from memory and direct placement to memory face down!
>
> If you have any further questions, comments, or suggestions for possible features, please post them in our Discord in our TTS discussion and help channel!

> **Untap.in**
>
> Untap.in is another way to try the Grand Archive print and play decks! The main difference between this and TTS is that Untap.in is complete free, and requires no download!

> ...
>
> #### Version 1.1 Changes
>
> This section covers more in detail over the design choices made for the 1.1 update. It gets pretty technical, so if you're not into this, feel free to skip this section!
>
> **Feedback #1:** "I want to play more cards! I feel like I run out of cards too fast."
>
> Grand Archive was designed to be a slower game compared to other anime TCGs. The early game is filled with intricate decision making due to the memory system. We want to keep things this way because we want the design space of slower decks. We believe that it's a lot easier to speed up the pace of gameplay through card design rather than slowing it down, which is why we're careful with this. That being said, there are ways to solve the issue, allowing players to play more cards on average in the early.
>
> **Solution:** A new evergreen keyword called "Floating Memory" has been added to a few cards in the starter decks. A card with **Floating Memory** can be banished from your graveyard to pay for a memory cost. This allows cards to be designed so that it can be used two times more than before: once for its actual effect, and one for paying for memory costs. Overall, players will be losing less cards from their hand due to paying from memory costs!

> Cost 3 -> 2
> 
> Attack 2 -> 1
> 
> Loses Intercept
> 
> Now has Floating Memory (While paying for a memory cost, you may banish this card from your graveyard to pay for 1 of that cost.)
> 
> 
> **Favorable Winds**
> 
> Now only gives +1 life instead of both attack and life.
> 
> Now has Floating Memory (While paying for a memory cost, you may banish this card from your graveyard to pay for 1 of that cost.)
> 
> 
> Because Honorable Vanguard loses intercept, it is not as useful in the Rai deck anymore.
> 
> New card **Ignite the Soul** replaces **Honorable Vanguard** as a 4 of in the Rai starter deck.
> 
> Fire Mage Action Fast
> 
> Cost 1
> 
> Deal 1 damage to target unit.
> 
> Class Bonus: Floating Memory (While paying for a memory cost, you may banish this card from your graveyard to pay for 1 of that cost.)
>
>
> **Feedback #2:** "Lorraine's attack cards don't feel good to use!"
> 
> Previously, Lorraine's attack cards did an awkward amount of damage when it was use. It overkilled opposing allies, or did too little damage to put enough pressure when used to attack the enemy champion.  We agree that attack cards in general are too weak.
> 
> **Solution:** Buff attack cards in general. The new attack card changes should also make Lorraine's goals a bit more clear: "Use allies to clear interceptors, and have Lorraine swing in for big damage." 
> 
> **Savage Slash**
> 
> Base Attack 2 -> 3
> 
> No longer has "Class Bonus Level 2+: Savage Slash gets +1 attack."
> 
> Now has Class Bonus: Floating Memory (While paying for a memory cost, you may banish this card from your graveyard to pay for 1 of that cost.)
> 
> **Sudden Steel**
> 
> Base Attack 3 -> 5
> 
> All effects are removed and replaced with Class Bonus: Efficiency
> 
> 
> **Feedback #3:** "There are issues with mirror matches (Rai vs Rai, or Lorraine vs Lorraine)." 
> 
> Currently, it is very difficult to deal with Dream Fairy as a Lorraine deck. On the other hand, Endura, Sceptre of Ignition was too effective in clearing an opposing Rai's allies. 
> 
> **Solution:** Lorraine gets a new tool to deal with Dream Fairy, and Endura is getting nerfed.
> 
> New card **Sword of Seeking** replaces **Avenger's Ring** in the material deck.
> 
> Regalia Weapon Warrior Sword
> 
> Memory Cost 0
> 
> Attack 1
> 
> Durability 1
> 
> Class Bonus: True Sight (Attacks with this weapon can target units with stealth.)
> 
> **Dream Fairy** 
> 
> Cost 2 -> 3
> 
> Opponent puts top card of deck into memory on death -> Opponent draws a card on death
> 
> **Endura, Sceptre of Ignition**
> 
> Ability can now only be activated at slow speed.
>
>
> **Feedback #4:** "I want to do more with Rai earlier on, besides playing an interceptor and pass."
> 
> Previously, Rai's allies focused on defending Rai, usually with Intercept. These allies were never real threats that Lorraine had to worry about. Because of this, Rai players never get to experience the dance that is the combat system in Grand Archive. 
> 
> **Solution:** Make Rai's allies more threatening so that they can actually trade with opposing allies. Alongside the new Ignite the Soul card added to Rai starter deck, the game should feel a lot more interactive earlier on. 
> 
> **Impassioned Tutor**
> 
> Attack 0 -> 1
> 
> No longer has level increasing activated ability.
> 
> No longer has Intercept.
> 
> Now has "Whenever Impassioned Tutor attacks, your champion gains +1 level until end of turn." 
> 
> **Barrier Servant**
> 
> Attack 1 -> 2
> 
> Life 3 -> 2
> 
> *Barrier Servant's ability to stall out games was too effective later on. So we're making it more usable early, and less strong later.*
>
>
> **Feedback #5:** "Lorraine leveling up to level 3 and unlocking Crux element never feels worth it!" 
> 
> Crux element is an element that specializes in gimmicks like flickering objects, and recursion. As an identity, it is certainly not as exciting Arcane, where you get to deal 11 damage with Arcane Blast. Currently, the Crux element cards in Lorraine starter deck are too weak for players to get a feel of what Crux does in general. 
> 
> **Solution:** Buff Crux cards as well as make Lorraine's level 3 more accessible. With the previously mentioned Floating Memory cards in Lorraine starter deck, achieving level 3 is a lot easier to achieve and less taxing to the hand size. Also, with the addition of the second 0 cost weapon, it is easier to stack Lorraine, Crux Knight's passive.
> 
> **Spectral Shift** Keyword
> 
> Additional Cost 3 -> 2
> 
> This affects **Crux Sight** and **Spirit Blade: Ghost Strike**
> 
> **Spirit Blade: Ghost Strike**
> 
> Cost 1 -> 0
> 
> **Prismatic Edge**
> 
> Attack 1 -> 3
>
>
> **Feedback #6:** "Rai's combo is too hard/complicated to use!"
>
> When players initially learn to play Grand Archive, they will first focus on the core rules of the game, and expect the starter decks to play themselves. However, the previous iteration of the Rai starter deck relied on knowing how to do the Arcane Blast copy combo beforehand. 
>
> **Solution:** Change Rai, Storm Seer's (Lv3) effect so that it provides consistent value, making him less combo oriented, at least within a single turn. 
> 
> **Rai, Storm Seer**
> 
> No longer has the ability to copy actions.
> 
> Now has "Rai gains +1 level for each Arcane element mage card in your banishment."
> 
> *Now, Rai's ability is symmetrical with Lorraine, Crux Knight's ability. In addition, it encourages players to banish Arcane element cards for memory costs earlier on, making their hand more relevant anyways.* 
> 
> Rai now relies on more Arcane element cards to win, so the card count has been modified for his starter deck. 
> 
> **Blitz Mage** goes from 4x to 2x.
> 
> **Arcane Sight** goes from 3x to 4x.
> 
> **Arcane Blast** goes from 3x to 4x.
>
>
> **Feedback #7:** "I draw too many Crux cards as Lorraine!"
> 
> Currently, most players never even bother with going Crux element as Lorraine. This means Crux element cards are only ever used to pay for reserve and memory costs. Usually this is fine, but Lorraine starter deck lack lower costed cards which enable the ability to control what gets used to pay for memory costs. 
> 
> **Solution:** This issue has been solved within the previously mentioned changes. The lower cost of Honorable Vanguard helps control what gets banished when paying for memory costs. In addition, Crux element being buffed makes players consider going level 3 more, even more so when considering the new Floating Memory revisions. 
> 
> 
> **Other Changes** 
> 
> The rest of these changes are just minor buffs to cards that have been underperforming, or other minor tweaks. 
> 
> **Inspiring Call** 
> 
> Cost 3 -> 4
> 
> Now only gives +1 attack instead of both attack and life.
> 
> Now has "Draw a card."
> 
> **Focused Flames** 
> 
> Cost 3 -> 2
> 
> Class Bonus & Focus: This card costs 3 less -> 2 less.
> 
> **Esteemed Knight**
> 
> Gains Intercept
> 
> **Magus Disciple**
> 
> Class Bonus: Your champion gets +1 level. -> No longer needs Class Bonus.
> 
> When Magus Disciple dies, draw a card. -> Now requires Class Bonus.
> 
> 
> That's all for the PnP changes! The TTS mod will be updated to this new PnP version sometime this weekend. We excited to have everyone try out the new changes and collect feedback!
