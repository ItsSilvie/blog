## Introduction

Stamped cards have existed in Grand Archive since the first set was launched, with artist signatures stamped in gold on [Dawn of Ashes First Edition](/DOA-1st_(set))'s Collector Ultra Rares and all following collector rare releases since then.

Grand Archive's [Index card database](https://index.gatcg.com) does a great job of revealing the populations of each uniquely-numbered card and rarity combination in each set, but it doesn't distinguish between different stamps a card may have.

This article attempts to break down each uniquely-stamped card and is an aside to the [Top 100 Grand Archive cards by lowest population](/top-100-lowest-pop) article which dynamically lists the top 100 cards which have the smallest print run.

Note that this article does not discuss repeated signature stamps on Collector Super Rare or Collector Promo Rare cards - these cards all share the same stamps and do not exist without the stamped variant.

## Path of Steel

Path of Steel is the primary attraction at Ascent tournaments, where participants compete to become the top Grand Archive player.

These events typically award the top 32 players with a Top 32-stamped Promo Rare card and the top 8 with a 1st through 8th-stamped Collector Promo Rare card. The cards also include the event's unique stamp (Ascent Houston, Ascent Auckland, Ascent Worlds, etc.).

## Dawn of Ashes First Edition

Main article: [Dawn of Ashes First Edition](/DOA-1st_(set)).

This set's 12 Collector Ultra Rare cards all have unique stamped serial numbers from 1 to 70. On top of that, the signatures on each of the cards are unique - no two Collector Ultra Rare signatures are the same.

## Errors

### P22 Banner Knight

In late 2023 Mitch (supermitch8) received his ambassador promo P22 Banner Knight card through for his work maintaining the Merlin's Marketplace Discord server and dedication to pricing transparency.

It was quickly discovered that his card was missing the artist's signature - which all copies of the card should have stamped on.

The Grand Archive team arranged for siglessmitch8 to return the card to them by in exchange for a corrected copy.
