## Set list

Cards in this set are prefixed `DOAp`.

{% include templates/DOAp.html %}

### Kickstarter exclusive pack contents

There are 55 cards available from the Kickstarter exclusive Dawn of Ashes Prelude booster packs.

These include cards which are either not found in the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks, or versions of those cards which instead include "KS" number prefix and the Kickstarter logo. The exceptions to this are the uncommon cards Anger the Skies, Blitz Mage, Disorienting Winds and Spirit Blade: Infusion which are shared between the decks and packs without change.

## Print quality

The cards found in the Dawn of Ashes Prelude booster packs were printed before those found in the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks. Between the two prints, some colour adjustments were made to the set to improve the appearance of each card. Because of this, the cards in the booster packs appear more vibrant than those in the Starter Decks.

### Anger the Skies, Blitz Mage, Disorienting Winds and Spirit Blade: Infusion

Anger the Skies, Blitz Mage, Disorienting Winds and Spirit Blade: Infusion all appear in both the Prelude booster packs and one a starter decks without having their number changed. As such, the difference in print runs is quite noticable on copies of these cards found in the decks compared to those pulled from booster packs:

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOAp/blitz-mage.png" description="DOAp Blitz Mage starter deck print (left) vs booster pack print (right)." %}

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOAp/disorienting-winds.png" description="DOAp Disorienting Winds starter deck print (left) vs booster pack print (right)." %}

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOAp/spirit-blade-infusion.png" description="DOAp Spirit Blade: Infusion starter deck print (left) vs booster pack print (right)." %}

This is something which affects all copies of these cards. The 15,000 Disorienting Winds and Spirit Blade: Infusion cards that are found in the Lorraine Starter Decks, and 15,000 Anger the Skies and Blitz Mage cards that are found in the Rai Starter Decks have a more subtle appearance compared to the 4,000 versions of each found in booster packs, which are more vibrant.

## History

The Dawn of Ashes Prelude set is an offshoot of the main [Dawn of Ashes First Edition](/DOA-1st_(set)) set.

It is made up of the prelude versions of the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks (as finalised in <span class="dead-link">[Print and Play version 1.3](/print-and-play)</span>) as well as cards from the 9-card Kickstarter exclusive booster packs.
