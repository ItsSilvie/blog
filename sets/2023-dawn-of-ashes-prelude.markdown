## Set list

Cards in this set are prefixed `DOAp`.

{% include templates/DOAp.html %}

### Kickstarter exclusive pack contents

There are 55 cards available from the Kickstarter exclusive Dawn of Ashes Prelude booster packs. These include cards which are either not found in the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks, or versions of those cards which instead include "KS" number prefix and the Kickstarter logo. The only exception to this is Blitz Mage, which was added late in the development process to make up numbers.

## Decks

### Lorraine Starter Deck (Prelude)

The Lorraine Starter Deck is a <span class="dead-link">[Wind](/elements#wind)</span>/<span class="dead-link">[Crux](/elements#crux)</span> deck tailored towards aggro and mid-range combat, featuring champion <span class="dead-link">[Lorraine Allard](/champions#lorraine-allard)</span>.

## Print quality

The cards found in the Dawn of Ashes Prelude booster packs were printed before those found in the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks. Between the two prints, some colour adjustments were made to the set to improve the appearance of each card. Because of this, the cards in the booster packs appear more vibrant than those in the Starter Decks.

### Blitz Mage

Blitz Mage is the only card in the set to appear in both the Prelude booster packs and one a starter deck without having its number changed. As such, the difference in print runs is quite noticable on copies of this card found in the decks compared to those pulled from booster packs:

This is something which affects all copies of Blitz Mage. The 15,000 Blitz Mage cards that are found in the Rai Starter Deck have a more subtle appearance compared to the 4,000 booster pack versions of the card, which are more vibrant.

## History

The Dawn of Ashes Prelude set is an offshoot of the main <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes](/DOA_(set))</span> set.

It is made up of the prelude versions of the Lorraine and Rai Starter Decks (as finalised in <span class="dead-link">[Print and Play version 1.3](/print-and-play)</span>) as well as cards from the 9-card Kickstarter exclusive booster packs.
