You may be looking for the <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span> set.

The Dawn of Ashes First Edition set is scheduled to be released in January 2023.

## Set list

Cards in this set are prefixed `DOA 1st`*.

{% include templates/DOA-1st.html %}

\* Two of the cards are erroneously printed as `DOA` instead of `DOA 1st`. See [Missing "1st" prefix"](#missing-1st-prefix).

## Pack contents

Each Dawn of Ashes First Edition booster box contains 24 booster packs, and each booster pack contains 12 cards (288 cards per box).

The cards each pack contains are primarily determined by card rarity, with some extra logic on top to include or exclude specific cards at specific rates.

Cards are determined by their position in the pack, denoted as "slots":

* Slot 1 will always contain a main champion (Lorraine, Rai, Silvie or Zander) weighted by level (see below);
* Slots 2 through 8 will contain a non-duplicate common;
* Slot 9 will either contain a non-duplicate common, a foil (1/8 chance) or a collector ultra rare (1/357 chance*);
* Slot 10 and 11 will contain a non-duplicate uncommon;
* Slot 12 will either contin a rare, a super rare (1/4 chance) or an ultra rare (1/24 chance).

The Spirit champions (Spirit of Fire, Water and Wind) are not found in booster packs - these are instead included in box topper packs which contain 2 of each non-foil. The Lineage Break champions (Allen, Merlin, Mordred and Tristan) are only available as non-foil, with their foil variants being exclusively found in <span class="dead-link">[Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span>.

Non-foil main champion cards will only appear in the first slot of each pack. There is a 1/2 chance this will be a level 1, a 1/3 chance for level 2 and a 1/6 chance for a level 3. Main champion foil cards can appear in slot 9 at the same rate as regular common cards.

Foil rates are also weighted by rarity, with common cards having the highest chance of being found. There is no duplication logic on the foil card included, meaning it is possible for a pack to contain both the non-foil and foil version of the same card.

\* The actual collector ultra rare chance is 7/2,500 (0.28%) which I've noted as 1/357 here for simplicity (0.2801%).

### Non-foil pull rates

The below table gives the chance of pulling any specific non-foil card from the set based on its rarity.

The `MPR` column in the table below denotes the minimum number of packs theoretically and statistically required for all individual cards of that rarity to be pulled. These numbers assume no duplicates and as such are unrealistic.

Rarity | Total | Chance | MPR
:-- | --: | --: | --:
Common* | 99 | 7.79% | 11 to 13
Uncommon | 72 | 2.77% | 36
Rare | 53 | 1.34% | 53 to 75
Super Rare | 31 | 0.81% | 31 to 124
Ultra Rare | 5 | 0.83% | 5 to 120

\* Excludes spirit and main champion cards as noted above.

### Foil pull rates

There is a 1 in 8 chance to pull a common through ultra rare foil card from any Dawn of Ashes First Edition booster pack, with a ~1 in 357 chance of pulling a collector ultra rare.

Foil cards are weighted by their rarity, with each common foil having a population of 157, uncommon 141, rare 127, super rare 109 and ultra rare 90, before being offset by the total number of cards in each rarity bracket.

The below table gives the chance of pulling any specific foil card from the set based on its rarity.

The `PPF` column denotes how many packs are statistically required to be opened in order to pull any foil of that rarity.

The `MPR` column denotes the minimum number of packs theoretically and statistically required for all individual cards of that rarity to be pulled. These numbers assume no duplicates and as such are unrealistic.

Rarity | Total | Chance | PPF | MPR
:-- | --: | --: | --: | --:
Common* | 107 | 0.052% | 18 | 107 to 1,912
Uncommon | 72 | 0.047% | 30 | 72 to 2,129
Rare | 53 | 0.042% | 45 | 53 to 2,363
Super Rare | 31 | 0.036% | 89 | 31 to 2,754
Ultra Rare | 5 | 0.03% | 667 | 5 to 3,335
Collector Ultra Rare | 12 | 0.023% | 357 | 12 to 4,285

\* Excludes spirit and lineage champion cards as noted above.

## Errors

### Missing "1st" prefix

During a couple of prerelease events which occurred in December 2022, fans noticed that two of the cards used the set prefix "DOA" instead of "DOA 1st".

When this was discovered, "DOA" (Dawn of Ashes) without the "1st", was intended to be the set prefix for the <span class="dead-link">[Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span> version of the set.

The cards affected by this error are [Juggle Knives (EN-095)](/juggle-knives_(card)#doa%201st--en-095-c) and [Restorative Slash (EN-185)](/restorative-slash_(card)#doa%201st--en-185-c). These cards do not exist with the "DOA 1st" prefix.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOA-1st/missing-1st.png" description="Juggle Knives and Restorative Slash." max-width="100%" %}

Following this discovery the Grand Archive developers decided to modify all Alter Edition cards to use "DOA Alter" set prefix instead to avoid confusion.
