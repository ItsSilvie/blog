You may be looking for the <span class="dead-link">[Dawn of Ashes Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span> set.

The Dawn of Ashes First Edition set is scheduled to be released in January 2023.

## Set list

Cards in this set are prefixed `DOA 1st`*.

{% include templates/DOA-1st.html %}

\* Two of the cards are erroneously printed as `DOA` instead of `DOA 1st`. See [Missing "1st" prefix"](#missing-1st-prefix).

## Print run

The First Edition set was printed exclusively as an early release for those who backed Grand Archive's [Kickstarter campaign](/kickstarter). There was a 20,000 booster box limit, and at the end of the campaign 1,539 backers had placed orders for ~11,500 of them.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOA-1st/ks-dynamic-print-run.png" description="Dynamic print run information from the Kickstarter campaign." max-width="100%" %}

The Grand Archive team announced that they'd be manufacturing an additional 1,000 boxes to ensure there was enough product in the event of shipping issues, with some of that amount used for pre-release events and giveaways.

In total, 12,500 booster boxes were created, giving a total of 300,000 booster packs. Each booster box includes a box topper pack containing 2 of each of the spirit champions (6 cards total), bringing the overall total to 3,675,000 Dawn of Ashes First Edition cards printed.

Rarity | Non-foil | Foil
:-- | --: | --:
Common | 2,736,660 (74.47%) | 16,799 (0.46%)
Uncommon | 600,000 (16.33%) | 10,152 (0.28%)
Rare | 212,500 (5.78%) | 6,731 (0.18%)
Super Rare | 75,000 (2.04%) | 3,379 (0.09%)
Ultra Rare | 12,500 (0.34%) | 450 (0.01%)
Collector Ultra Rare | - | 840 (0.02%)

## Pack contents

Each Dawn of Ashes First Edition booster box contains 24 booster packs, and each booster pack contains 12 cards (288 cards per box).

The cards each pack contains are primarily determined by card rarity, with some extra logic on top to include or exclude specific cards at specific rates.

Cards are determined by their position in the pack, denoted as "slots":

* Slot 1 will always contain a main champion (Lorraine, Rai, Silvie or Zander) weighted by level (see below);
* Slots 2 through 8 will contain a non-duplicate common;
* Slot 9 will either contain a non-duplicate common, a foil (1/8 chance) or a collector ultra rare (1/357 chance*);
* Slot 10 and 11 will contain a non-duplicate uncommon;
* Slot 12 will either contin a rare, a super rare (1/4 chance) or an ultra rare (1/24 chance).

The Spirit champions (Spirit of Fire, Water and Wind) are not found in booster packs - these are instead included in box topper packs which contain 2 of each non-foil. The Lineage Break champions (Allen, Merlin, Mordred and Tristan) are only available as non-foil, with their foil variants being exclusively found in <span class="dead-link">[Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span>.

Non-foil main champion cards will only appear in the first slot of each pack. There is a 1/2 chance this will be a level 1, a 1/3 chance for level 2 and a 1/6 chance for a level 3. Main champion foil cards can appear in slot 9 at the same rate as regular common cards.

Foil rates are also weighted by rarity, with common cards having the highest chance of being found. There is no duplication logic on the foil card included, meaning it is possible for a pack to contain both the non-foil and foil version of the same card.

\* The actual collector ultra rare chance is 840 in 300,000 packs (0.28%) which I've noted as 1/357 here for simplicity (0.2801%).

### Non-foil pull rates

The below table gives the chance of pulling any specific non-foil card from the set based on its rarity.

The `MPR` column in the table below denotes the minimum number of packs theoretically and statistically required for all individual cards of that rarity to be pulled. These numbers assume no duplicates and as such are unrealistic.

Rarity | Total | Chance | MPR
:-- | --: | --: | --:
Common* | 99 | 7.79% | 11 to 13
Uncommon | 72 | 2.77% | 36
Rare | 53 | 1.34% | 53 to 75
Super Rare | 31 | 0.81% | 31 to 124
Ultra Rare | 5 | 0.83% | 5 to 120

\* Excludes spirit and main champion cards as noted above.

### Foil pull rates

There is a 1 in 8 chance to pull a common through ultra rare foil card from any Dawn of Ashes First Edition booster pack, with a ~1 in 357 chance of pulling a collector ultra rare.

Foil cards are weighted by their rarity, with each common foil having a population of 157, uncommon 141, rare 127, super rare 109 and ultra rare 90, before being offset by the total number of cards in each rarity bracket.

The below table gives the chance of pulling any specific foil card from the set based on its rarity.

The `PPF` column denotes how many packs are statistically required to be opened in order to pull any foil of that rarity.

The `MPR` column denotes the minimum number of packs theoretically and statistically required for all individual cards of that rarity to be pulled. These numbers assume no duplicates and as such are unrealistic.

Rarity | Total | Chance | PPF | MPR
:-- | --: | --: | --: | --:
Common* | 107 | 0.052% | 18 | 107 to 1,912
Uncommon | 72 | 0.047% | 30 | 72 to 2,129
Rare | 53 | 0.042% | 45 | 53 to 2,363
Super Rare | 31 | 0.036% | 89 | 31 to 2,754
Ultra Rare | 5 | 0.03% | 667 | 5 to 3,335
Collector Ultra Rare | 12 | 0.023% | 357 | 12 to 4,285

\* Excludes spirit and lineage champion cards as noted above.

## What are the differences between First Edition and Alter Edition?

The short answer...

- First Edition features collector ultra rare versions of each main champion card, whereas Alter Edition does not;
- Alter Edition includes foil versions of the lineage break champion cards, whereas First Edition does;
- Alter Edition features collector super rare versions of the lineage break champion cards, whereas First Edition does not;
- First Edition is prefixed `DOA 1st`, whereas Alter Edition is prefixed `DOA Alter`.

The long answer...

For the majority of cards, the only visual difference between the Dawn of Ashes First Edition and <span class="dead-link">[Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span> sets is the set prefix. First Edition is prefixed with `DOA 1st` whilst Alter Edition is prefixed `DOA Alter`.

The First Edition set was printed exclusively as an early release for backers of Grand Archive's [Kickstarter campaign](/kickstarter), whereas Alter Edition is regarded as Grand Archive's public release. As such, the First Edition set has a significantly smaller [print run](#print-run).

The First Edition set features collector ultra rare versions of each of the 12 main champion cards. Only 70 of each of these collector ultra rare cards were printed, each individually signed with a serial number from 1 to 70.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOA-1st/curs.png" description="The level 3 collector ultra rare champion cards." max-width="600px" %}

Alter Edition doesn't include these collector ultra rare cards, but instead includes collector super rare versions of the 4 lineage break champions, Allen, Merlin, Mordred and Tristan.

Only 1 in 15 First Edition booster boxes contain a collector ultra rare, making them very scarce. Initial reports suggest that the population of collector super rare cards from Alter Edition "would only be 625 with 100,000 boxes printed", which with only 4 cards to choose from this results in a much less frequent 1 in 40 booster box rate.

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOA-1st/merlin-csr.jpg" description="The Alter Edition Merlin collector super rare from Grand Archive's Twitter feed." max-width="600px" %}

Alongside the collector super rare versions of the lineage break champions, Alter Edition also includes foil versions of those cards which are not included in the First Edition set.

## Errors

### Missing "1st" prefix

After the Dawn of Ashes First Edition print run had finished, the developers noticed that two of the cards had erroneously been printed with the set prefixed "DOA" instead of "DOA 1st".

"DOA" (Dawn of Ashes) without the "1st", was originally intended to be the set prefix for the <span class="dead-link">[Alter Edition](/DOA-Alter_(set))</span> version of the set. However following this discovery the Grand Archive developers decided to modify all Alter Edition cards to use "DOA Alter" as their set prefix instead to avoid confusion.

The cards affected by this error are [Juggle Knives (EN-095)](/juggle-knives_(card)#doa%201st--en-095-c) and [Restorative Slash (EN-185)](/restorative-slash_(card)#doa%201st--en-185-c).

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/sets/DOA-1st/missing-1st.png" description="Juggle Knives and Restorative Slash." max-width="100%" %}

All copies of these cards have the "DOA" prefix; these do not exist with the "DOA 1st" prefix.
