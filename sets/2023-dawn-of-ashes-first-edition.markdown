## Errors

### Missing "1st" prefix

During a couple of prerelease events which occurred in December 2022, fans noticed that two of the cards used the set prefix "DOA" instead of "DOA 1st".

When this was discovered, "DOA" (Dawn of Ashes) without the "1st", was intended to be the set prefix for the <span class="dead-link">[Alter Edition](/DOA_Alter_(set))</span> version of the set.

The cards affected by this error are [Juggle Knives (EN-095)](/juggle-knives_(card)#doa%201st--en-095-c) and [Restorative Slash (EN-185)](/restorative-slash_(card)#doa%201st--en-185-c). These cards do not exist with the "DOA 1st" prefix.

Following this discovery the Grand Archive developers decided to modify all Alter Edition cards to use "DOA Alter" set prefix instead to avoid confusion.
