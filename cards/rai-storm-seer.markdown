A foil version of the Rai, Storm Seer card was included in the [Kickstarter promo](/KSP_(set)) set.

This card was announced alongside the [Lorraine, Crux Knight (KSP &middot; EN-002 PR)](/lorraine-crux-knight#ksp--en-002-pr) Kickstarter promo on 27th December 2021 in [Kickstarter update #9](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weebs/grand-archive-tcg/posts/3394515).

Encouraged as tournament prizes or free gifts included with purchases, all Game Store Tier 1 and Game Store Tier 2 <span class="dead-link">[Kickstarter backers](/kickstarter#tiers)</span> received one copy of this and [Lorraine, Crux Knight (KSP &middot; EN-002 PR)](/lorraine-crux-knight#ksp--en-002-pr) for every starter kit they ordered.

This card was originally identified as KS PROMO-006.

By default each Game Store Tier 1 backer received 6 starter kits and each Game Store Tier 2 backer received 18. Whilst we do not know how many additional starter kits were ordered as add-ons, we can use this to say that this card has a population of at least 2,358.
